- Beautiful sliding index page illustrates the traditional Chinese aesthetic. The idea was hard to implement due to the limited amount of time and all of our team member do not have much experiences with web development. Luckliy we found some code from [tympanus.net](http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/CSS3FullscreenSlideshow/) which partically fits our idea. However, the code used a lot of absolute positioning. We had to do a lot of modifications and debuging to make it get along with other parts.
- We added animated social sharing links in the index pages. The idea was inspired by [luuman](https://github.com/luuman/Share).
- The design of the post pages achieves conciseness while still provides necessary functions. We put a lot of efforts on tweeking the style and overall looks of the pages.
- The tag plugin, which is our main interative part, utilies javascript and HTML5 Speech Synthesis API to speak provided texts. It is designed speak Chinese with magnified text to help learner grasp Chinese pronunciation. The plugin can be easily extended for any languages.
