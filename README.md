## Key Components
- Beautiful sliding index page illustrates the traditional Chinese aesthetic. The idea was hard to implement due to the limited amount of time and all of our team member do not have much experiences with web development. Luckliy we found some code from [tympanus.net](http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/CSS3FullscreenSlideshow/) which partically fits our idea. However, the code uses a lot of absolute positioning. We had to make a lot of modifications and debuging to make it get along with other parts.
- We added animated social sharing links in the index pages. The idea was inspired by [luuman](https://github.com/luuman/Share).
- The design of the post pages achieves conciseness while still provides necessary functions. We put a lot of efforts on tweeking the styles and the overall looks of the pages.
- The WordCard plugin, which is our main interative part, utilies JavaScript and HTML5 Speech Synthesis API to speak provided texts. It is designed to speak Chinese with magnified text to help learners grasp Chinese pronunciation. The plugin can be easily extended for any other languages.
